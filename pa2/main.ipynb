    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset required adjustments to the hyperparameters due to differences in data complexity and size. The large dataset (`toydata_large`) required a narrower range of epochs and a smaller set of learning rate options due to computational constraints, despite its successful outcomes. The different models within the same dataset also showed variability in optimal parameters, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches based on both the model type and the specific characteristics of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "However some similarities can be seen for example the batch size of 10 seems to be the best one in most cases. Also the learning rate should be kind of small meaning that the learning rates of 0.5+ were never selected while we tested some of them. Also interesting is that the gamma was most of the times choosen with 0.1 and the number of features is not always the biggest one that was choosen for the rff. All of this can of course depend on some randomness that comes with each test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obvious is also from the optimal parameters that they match much closer between the both toydatas than between the toydata and the imdb as these two datasets are much more similar. \n"

    "  - *Observation:* As with the `toydata_large` dataset, no difference in final accuracy was noted. \n",

    "- **`imdb` dataset:**\n",
    "  - **SGD (Linear model):** Best Accuracy = 0.763\n",
    "  - **Adagrad (Linear model):** Best Accuracy = 0.765\n",
    "  - *Observation:* The Adagrad optimizer showed a slight improvement over standard SGD. This suggests that Adagrad's adaptive learning rates were beneficial for handling the more diverse and complex features.\n",

    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of Adagrad compared to standard SGD varies based on the complexity and characteristics of the dataset:\n",
    "- When the feature scales are relatively uniform and the data is less sparse (`toydata` series), the advantage of Adagrad in terms of performance might not be significant.\n",
    "- Also the first dataset is really easy for a svm and therefore all implementations perform really well and there is not too much difference to be seen here \n",
    "- For datasets like `imdb`, which likely contain more sparse and irregular data (common in text data), Adagrad can outperform standard SGD by adapting the learning rates to the nature of each feature, leading to more efficient learning dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeat your experiments using random dropout of input features with probabilityp = 0.5 for the IMDB data. Does this change affect performance and if so, how? \n",
    "\n",
    "So first I thought about what should happen. As the random dropout decreases the amount of features the algorithm can learn from it should decrease the performance (accuracy) of the algorithm. I mean it is probably faster but the accuracy should decrease. \n",
    "\n",
    "Results with droput:\n",
    "{'imdb': {'adagrad': {'Best Parameters': {'C': 0.5, 'epochs': 20, 'lr': 0.001, 'batch_size': 20}, 'Best Accuracy': 0.724}}}\n",
    "Runtime 6 seconds\n",

    "Runtime 7 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "So the accuracy decreased by 0.016 but the runtime decreased by 1 second. So the algorithm is faster but less accurate. Like predicted.\n",
    "However I am pretty suprised that the accuracy is still pretty high. I would have expected a bigger decrease in accuracy, as many \n",

    "The number of RFFs directly affects the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality vs. Complexity:** Increasing the number of RFFs enhances the model's capacity to represent more complex functions. A higher dimensionality can improve the accuracy of the approximation to the desired kernel function, potentially leading to better classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting vs. Underfitting:** With too few Fourier features, the model may underfit, failing to capture essential data characteristics. Conversely, too many features might lead to overfitting, particularly in scenarios with limited training data, where the model learns noise in the training set rather than generalizing from true underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational Efficiency:** A larger number of features increases computational cost, both in terms of memory and processing time. This factor must be balanced against the potential gains in model accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Toydata Tiny and Large datasets:** A moderate number of RFFs (e.g., 500-1000) already achieved the maximum accuracy. This indicates that beyond a certain threshold, additional features do not necessarily improve performance, likely due to the simpler nature of the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IMDb dataset:** A significant improvement in accuracy was observed when increasing the number of RFFs from 1000 to 2000.
