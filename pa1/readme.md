# README How to use this Notebook

## Introduction
This readme describes how to use the pa1.ipynb file in this directory. The report is also in the juypter notebook file in the bottom and please make sure to have the csv files ready. 

## Getting Started
To get started, make sure you have all the necessary Python imports installed. If any of the imports are missing, you can use the `pip install` command to install the required dependencies. Alternatively, you can use an IDE like PyCharm, which may assist you in resolving any dependency issues.

## Running the Notebook
To run this notebook, simply execute each cell in sequential order. Each cell contains a block of code or markdown text that serves a specific purpose. You can run the cells individually or use the "Run All" option to execute all cells at once.
For the data make sure that the two files `tracks.csv` and `features.csv` are in the same directory as this notebook!

## Important Note
Please note that the parameter optimization at the end of the notebook can be time-consuming. If you wish, you can skip the last few cells to save time. However, keep in mind that skipping these cells may affect the accuracy of the genre classification.
